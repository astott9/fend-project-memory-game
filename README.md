# Memory Game - Project 2

This project uses **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** to present a simple memory game in the form of matching cards. A set of randomly shuffled cards is displayed face-down on the screen, the user is required to click on two cards per turn to flip them over to find a match. The game will log how many moves are required to find all matches, as well as time the game, and determine a star rating. This score is then compared against the highest score achieved on that device, and if better, a new high score is achieved.

## Getting Started

* Open `index.html` in your browser of choice


## Instructions

* The game starts as soon as the first card is flipped over, by clicking or tapping it
* To complete the turn, choose another card
    * if a match is found, the pair of cards will turn green and remain face-up
    * if no match is found, the cards will turn red, and then flip back over
